# GenOS Build Scripts #
#######################

These scripts allow you to create a custom build of GenOS with your own predefined settings, applications, etc.

----------Â|
How To Use
----------

First, grab a fresh copy of the latest GenOS. Install it in your computer or in a virtual machine.

You can now customize the installed system as you want the custom build to be. Keep in mind to not install any video drivers.

Time to start building. 

If you want to include the changes you made to your user account like icons and widgets, change to this directory and run in a terminal window:

sh 1_prepare_user.sh

After it is done (or if you didn't want to do it) run in a terminal window:

sh 2_build_iso.sh

Wait some minutes and you'll have a nice build.iso in your home folder when it's done.

Burn it or run it in a virtual machine to make sure it works as desired and enjoy :)
